# Email and Text Message Subscribe Website

This repo is used to hold the code for the front facing [Boston DevC subscribe page](https://boston-devc.github.io/Subscribe/) for our MailChimp and Twilio subscription sign up forms.

## How it's deployed

The website itself is hosted directly through GitHub pages. It will automatically deploy to match whatever is in the `master` branch. 

## How to use for your own DevC

If you fork this repository, and make the appropriate updates to match your MailChimp form URL and your text subscription form URL then you'll be good to. You'll just need to set up [GitHub pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) to make a URL go live.
